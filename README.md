## Architecture Overview

Entry point: src/index.ts

AppController handles all incoming requests, responsible for request processing, calling the appropriate service, and forming responses.

The application's business logic is executed within separate services:

- CreateShortCodeService - handles new code registration functionality, encapsulates the logic for generating new codes (currently just a timestamp) and other necessary functionality
- ShortCodeService - handles logic for other requests
